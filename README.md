# Blog Application
 
I created the application by following along with https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

Within the application the user can do the following.

Register, reset their password, edit their about me section in there profile, post, explore posts, follow and unfollow users.

Please make sure you set the values in config.py or you may run into issues.
